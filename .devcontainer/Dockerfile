# ToggleTheme - Windows C# Application
# This Dockerfile is not used for this project.
# The devcontainer.json uses a pre-built .NET image instead.
#
# Note: This is a Windows-specific application that requires:
# - MSBuild (Visual Studio Build Tools)
# - .NET Framework 4.7.2
# - Windows API access for theme switching
#
# For development, use Windows with Visual Studio or VS Code with C# extensions.
# For CI/CD, GitHub Actions runs on Windows runners automatically.
